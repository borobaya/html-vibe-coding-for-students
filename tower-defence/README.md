# Tower Defence

A strategy game where you defend your base by placing turrets along a winding path to stop waves of enemies. Choose from multiple turret types, upgrade your defences, and manage your gold to survive increasingly difficult waves. Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- **Wave-based gameplay** with progressively harder enemies each round
- **Multiple turret types** with unique stats, range, and attack styles
- **Upgrade system** to boost turret damage, range, and fire rate
- **Enemy variety** including fast scouts, armoured tanks, and healing units
- **Gold economy** earned from defeating enemies, spent on turrets and upgrades
- **Lives system** — enemies that reach the end cost you lives
- **Interactive grid** for placing and selling turrets along the path
- **Wave counter and stats panel** showing current wave, gold, and lives
- **Start wave button** so you can prepare your defences before each round
- **Visual projectiles and hit effects** rendered on the canvas
- **Responsive layout** that works on different screen sizes

## How to Play

1. Open the game and review the map — enemies follow the highlighted path
2. Select a turret type from the build menu
3. Click on a valid grid tile next to the path to place a turret
4. Press **Start Wave** when you are ready
5. Turrets automatically target and fire at enemies in range
6. Earn gold for each enemy defeated and spend it on new turrets or upgrades
7. Click an existing turret to upgrade or sell it
8. Survive as many waves as possible — the game ends when you run out of lives
